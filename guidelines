Create your HTML markup and CSS to position your square or shape. These will be the colors that are randomly selected for the game.
    challenge: build out your whole board using jquery/javascript
    4 squares have same class
    $('.square')
Randomly select a square and fade that color in then out.
    function randomNumber {
      generate random number between 0 and 3 or 1 and 4
      return number
    }
    function assignedSquare(randomNumber) {
      get squares and find one matching randomNumber
    }
    function illuminateSquare (assignedSquare) {
      animate square
    }
Allow the user to click on the square that was selected.

    $('.square').click(function(){
        illuminateSquare(this)
    })
Continue randomly selecting colored square/shapes adding the new random selection to be added to the previous selection. Eventually you will end up with a random sequence of selected colors.

    you will need a sequence. what do we have that can hold a sequence?
    look into setTimeout()
Each time a new color is added to the sequence allow the user to enter (click) the sequence in the order as it was played.
    you will need a way to check if the user click matches the sequence
If the user continues to get the order correct then proceed to adding another color to the collection until the user gets the order incorrectly.
    you will need to know when the user is done clicking to start computer turn again.  if user is wrong, game is over
Keep track of how many rounds the user is able to go.
    You will need some way to hold the rounds as well as someway to increase the number
